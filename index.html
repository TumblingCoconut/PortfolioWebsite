                    My name is Joseph Lam. I recently graduated from NYC Lab School for Collaborative Studies. 
                    I will be studying Computer Science at the University of Chicago this fall. 
                    Because of my interest in technology, I have some knowledge of electronics and programming languages such as Python, C, C++, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love everything that has to do with technology. 
                    Whether it is robotics or programming, I'm always ready for a challenge. 
                    When I'm not working on a project, I am happily reading or enjoying a game or anime. 
                    I'm always happy to talk about my hobbies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always called NYC home, but it is never a boring place to be. 
                    Walks are always exciting as you never know what you'll encounter. 
                    Having spent so much time here, I will miss the city when I head off to college
                </p>
                <p>
                    At UChicago, I hope to study and hone my programming skills to better help those around me. 
                    I've always wanted to build solutions to problems in the world, but more often than not, I'm limited by my ability.
